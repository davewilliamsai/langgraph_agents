Here are some scientific papers that discuss Symbolic Fourier Aggregation (SFA) and Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) in the context of process mining and related fields:

### Symbolic Fourier Aggregation (SFA)

1. **ASTRIDE: Adaptive Symbolization for Time Series Databases**
   - **Authors**: Sylvain W. Combettes, Charles Truong, Laurent Oudre
   - **Year**: 2023
   - **Summary**: This paper introduces ASTRIDE, a novel symbolic representation of time series, and compares it with SAX and SFA. It highlights the use of SFA in adaptive quantization of the frequency domain for time series data.

2. **Fast and Exact Similarity Search in less than a Blink of an Eye**
   - **Authors**: Patrick Sch√§fer, Jakob Brand, Ulf Leser, Botao Peng, Themis Palpanas
   - **Year**: 2024
   - **Summary**: This work presents the SymbOlic Fourier Approximation index (SOFA), which uses SFA for fast, exact similarity queries in high-frequency data series.

3. **Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX)**
   - **Authors**: K. Feasel
   - **Year**: 2022
   - **Summary**: This chapter provides an overview of SAX, its process, and its application in anomaly detection and time series analysis.
